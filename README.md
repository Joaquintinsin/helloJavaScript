# helloJavaScript
A repository where I learned JavaScript lang

# Quid novi
This repo contains Scrimba challenges and tutorials, JS code that I have been creating for better handling with some HTML and CSS code

# Tutorial
I entered for the first time in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8

But I moved to Scrimba instead, so I can be able to understand what the video says

So, I'm learning JavaScript by following the tutorial in https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v
